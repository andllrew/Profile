# About Me
I am a full-time undergraduate student attending Drexel University that is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With Computer Science being a relatively new field for me, I have been making an effort to learn new languages to strengthen my foundational knowledge of this area. My general interests are web development, machine learning, and algorithms.

## Programming Languages
